      <h1>What is breast screening (mammogram)?</h1>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Breast screening uses a special X-ray, called a mammogram, to check your breasts for signs of cancer.</li>
          <li>Breast screening is done by female health specialists called mammographers.</li>
          <li>It can find cancers that are too small to see or feel and have no symptoms.</li>
          <li>Finding breast cancer early means treatment is more likely to be successful and it's less likely you’ll need to have a breast removed <a href="javascript:void(0)">(mastectomy)</a>.</li>
          <li>Anyone registered with a GP as a woman will be invited for NHS breast screening every 3 years between the ages of 50 and their 71st birthday.</li>
          <li>Some trans and non-binary people should have breast screening, though they may not be invited automatically.</li>
          <li>You will be sent an invitation letter in the post when it’s time for you to have breast screening (mammogram).</li>
