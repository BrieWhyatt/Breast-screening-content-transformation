          <li>Breast screening uses a special X-ray, called a mammogram, to check your breasts for signs of cancer.</li>
          <li>Breast screening is done by female health specialists called mammographers.</li>
          <li>It can find cancers that are too small to see or feel and have no symptoms.</li>
          <li>Finding breast cancer early means treatment is more likely to be successful and it's less likely you’ll need to have a breast removed <a href="javascript:void(0)">(mastectomy)</a>.</li>
          <li>Anyone registered with a GP as a woman will be invited for NHS breast screening every 3 years between the ages of 50 and their 71st birthday.</li>
          <li>Some trans and non-binary people should have breast screening, though they may not be invited automatically.</li>
          <li>You will be sent an invitation letter in the post when it’s time for you to have breast screening (mammogram).</li>

        <p>Breast cancer screening services are now running.</p>
        <p>You may be prioritised if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you've been told you're at very high risk of getting breast cancer</li>
          <li>you're 53 or over and have never had a screening invitation</li>
          <li>you're over 70 but have not had a final invitation for screening</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to go to your appointment unless you or someone you live with has <a href="javascript:void(0);">symptoms of coronavirus</a>.</p>
        <p>Some people who've had the coronavirus vaccine may get swollen glands in their armpit or neck for a few days, which may be found during screening. But you should still go to your appointment if you've been vaccinated recently.</p>
        <p>Contact your GP surgery as soon as possible online or by phone if you think you may have <a href="javascript:void(0);">symptoms of breast cancer</a>.</p>
        <p>All NHS services are making sure it's safe for you to attend.</p>
